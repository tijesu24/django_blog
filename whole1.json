But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you?\r\n\r\nOK, this has gotta stop. I'm going to remind Fry of his humanity the way only a woman can. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? File not found.\r\n\r\nNo, she'll probably make me do it. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. Is that a cooking show? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court!\r\n\r\nDo a flip! Oh sure! Blame the wizards! Shut up and get to the point! Shut up and take my money! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring. You know the worst thing about being a slave? They make you work, but they don't pay you or let you go.\r\n\r\nWhoa a real live robot; or is that some kind of cheesy New Year's costume? I could if you hadn't turned on the light and shut off my stereo. OK, if everyone's finished being stupid. As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.\r\n\r\nYeah.

You've killed me! You don't know how to do any of those. No! I want to live! There are still too many things I don't own! As an interesting side note, as a head without a body, I envy the dead.\r\n\r\nMorbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat. Spare me your space age technobabble, Attila the Hun! Well I'da done better, but it's plum hard pleading a case while awaiting trial for that there incompetence.\r\n\r\nFive hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't veryà Can I use the gun?",
